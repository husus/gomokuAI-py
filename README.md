# Gomoku AI in Python
A simple Gomoku (or Five-In-A-Row) AI written in Python from scratch. 

## Overview
Gomoku is a strategy board game with 2 players and on a 15x15 board. The objective of the game is to form an unbroken chain of 5 stones (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) and the first player to do that wins the game. In this project, you can play against the AI that uses the MiniMax algorithm with alpha beta prunning in order to make the next move. Everything is integrated with a GUI made through `pygame`.

## Requirements
In order to run this program, the `pygame` library must be installed first:
```
$pip install pygame
```

## Execution
For playing against the AI, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/husus/gomokuAI-py
cd gomokuAI-py
python3 play.py
```
